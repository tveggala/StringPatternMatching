This code built and run on Intel P4Studio SDE environment (mimicing Tofino ASIC), in order to act as a FIREWALL.
This repository contains P4 source code that demonstrates the following (in a Programmable Data Plane).
1. How to perform payload inspection (DPI).
2. Iterating string, character by character using the technique of RECIRCULATE-AND-TRUNCATE.
3. Rejecting the String, when there is a match and allowing if there is no match.
