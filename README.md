This repository contains P4 source code that demonstrates the following (in a Programmable Data Plane)
1. How to perform payload inspection i.e., Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
2. Iterating string, character by character using the technique of RECIRCULATE-AND-TRUNCATE (as there is no direct support in a P4 switch).
